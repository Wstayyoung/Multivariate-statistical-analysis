# Primary R Data Structres
## 1.Modes and other attributes
In R,data is stored in objects.  
**Objects**:1.name, 2.contenes, 3.attributes(mode and length)

## 2.Vectors and list
Each of the objects in the example above is a vector, an ordered container of values that all have the same mode.The *c( )* function concatenates vectors (or lists).Notice that w, y, and z are vectors of length 1.   
Missing values are coded as *NA* (not available). Asking for an entry "off the end" of a vector returns *NA* . Assigning a value "of the end" of a vector results in the vector being lengthened so that the new value can be stored in the appropriate location.

The items in some vectors have names. These names can be used to help track which information is in which position. Names can be added to a vector in several ways, using *c()* , *names()* , or *setNames()* .

A list is similar to a vector, but its elements may be of different modes (including list, vector, etc.). As with vectors, items may be accessed either by index or by name.

## 3.Data Frames and Matrices
A data frame is a list of vectors (or factors), each of the same length, but not necessarily of the same mode. This is R's primary way of storing data sets. An array is a multi-dimensional table of values that all have the same mode. A matrix is a 2-dimensional array.  

The access operators ([ ] for vectors, matrices, arrays, and data frames, and [[ ]] for lists) are actually functions in R. This has some important consequences:Data frames and matrices have a dim attribute that stores the dimension of the object. The *dim()* function returns the dimensions of an object as a vector. Alternatively the number of rows and columns can be obtained using *nrow()* and *ncol()*. You can change the dimension attribute to change the shape of an array or matrix.

## 4.Attributes
You can see all of the non-intrinsic attributes (mode and length are intrinsic) using attributes(), and you can set attributes (including new ones you make up) using *attr()* .

Some attributes (e.g., dimension) have special functions (e.g., dim() for accessing or setting.
